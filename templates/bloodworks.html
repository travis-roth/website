Through interviews with both students and staff, we thoroughly investigated the factors influencing blood donation rates. Our objective was to identify strategies to bolster blood donations within the university community, recognizing the critical importance of blood in life-saving procedures. The culmination of our efforts was presented in a video that outlined our research process, highlighted key findings, and proposed actionable solutions aimed at increasing blood donations. This project not only provided insights into improving blood donation rates but also contributed to the noble cause of saving lives through enhanced blood donation initiatives.</p>
